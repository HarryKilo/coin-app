<div class="Emperors">
    <ol class="emperorsList">
        <li id="emperor"> <div class="emperorTitle">1. Constantine</div><br>
            It's nigh on impossible to overestimate Constantine's significance. With the possible exception of a little guy who wandered around Galilee for a few years with twelve of his mates, it’s hard to think of an individual who has had more of an impact on the history of the western world. Not only did he move the capital of the Roman empire to the more central and defensible Byzantium, later (modestly renamed) Constantinople, he only went and adopted Christianity as the official religion of the empire, effectively spelling the end for European polytheism and religious pluralism. A heavy hitter.

        </li>
        <li id="emperor"><div class="emperorTitle">2. Julian</div><br>
            One for the romantics among us. As Europe rumbled towards the Middle Ages, sodden with religious intolerance and superstition, Julian popped up as a brief reminder of the antique past. His noble, and plainly doomed, efforts to return the empire to polytheism, ‘paganism’ as it had become known, seem like the ‘last hurrah’ of a vanishing world, a final philosopher king, before a new dark age.

        </li>
        <li id="emperor"><div class="emperorTitle">3. Hadrian</div><br>
            The first of the so called ‘good emperors’, ‘busy’ might be a good word to characterise Hadrian - an Emperor who got things done. Not only did he set the limits of the Roman empire, with a series of walls and fortifications (one of which became rather famous) he himself visited nearly every province of the empire. An energetic leader, fighter and administrator, he is perhaps best known for deifying his boyfriend, the beautiful Antinous, who died in mysterious circumstances… in the Nile (the river in Egypt).

        </li>
        <li id="emperor"><div class="emperorTitle">4. Marcus Aurelius</div><br>
            The only emperor who wrote a self-help book, and a very good one, at that. An emperor who is as readily referred to as a philosopher, Marcus Aurelius was the last of the ‘good emperors’ of the 2nd C. AD. Not only a talented thinker, he led several successful military campaigns, against the Parthians and Germanic tribes. A truly thoughtful and effective leader who (unwittingly), through his Meditations, gave solace to many, many readers down the centuries.

        </li>
        <li id="emperor"><div class="emperorTitle">5. Augustus</div><br>
            He’s got to be in here, really. An absolute titan of Western civilisation, a man who shaped Europe’s geopolitics and all the symbolic forms of political power up to the present day. Through a combination of cunning and political nous, the young Octavian rose to a position of ultimate authority in a Roman empire beset by internecine rivalry and external enemies. He ran rings around older, seemingly more experienced rivals, and drove the final nail into the Roman republic’s coffin, instituting arguably the most well-known polity of all time, The Roman Empire.
